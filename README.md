Nine Old Androids
=================

Android library for using the [Honeycomb (Android 3.0) animation API][1] on all
versions of the platform back to 1.0!

Note: `LayoutTransition` and `AnimationInflater` are not present at this time.
`AnimationInflater` will be added at a later date. It is not possible to
implement `LayoutTransition` prior to Android 3.0.



Usage
=====

The API is exactly the same as the [Honeycomb API][2], just change your imports
to use `com.jakewharton.nineoldandroids.XXX`.

Take a look at a few demos taken from the [platform ApiDemos][3] in the
`sample/` folder. You can also try it out on the [Android Market][4].

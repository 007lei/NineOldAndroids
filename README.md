Nine Old Androids
=================

Android library for using the Honeycomb (Android 3.0) animation API on all
versions of the platform back to 1.0!

Note: `LayoutTransition` and `AnimationInflater` are not present at this time.
`AnimationInflater` will be added at a later date. It is not possible to
implement `LayoutTransition` prior to Android 3.0.

*More info coming soon*

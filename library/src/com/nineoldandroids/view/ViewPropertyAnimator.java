/**
 * This class enables automatic and optimized animation of select properties on View objects.
 * If only one or two properties on a View object are being animated, then using an
 * {@link android.animation.ObjectAnimator} is fine; the property setters called by ObjectAnimator
 * are well equipped to do the right thing to set the property and invalidate the view
 * appropriately. But if several properties are animated simultaneously, or if you just want a
 * more convenient syntax to animate a specific property, then ViewPropertyAnimator might be
 * more well-suited to the task.
 *
 * <p>This class may provide better performance for several simultaneous animations, because
 * it will optimize invalidate calls to take place only once for several properties instead of each
 * animated property independently causing its own invalidation. Also, the syntax of using this
 * class could be easier to use because the caller need only tell the View object which
 * property to animate, and the value to animate either to or by, and this class handles the
 * details of configuring the underlying Animator class and starting it.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is not constructed by the caller, but rather by the View whose properties
 * it will animate. Calls to {@link android.view.View#animate()} will return a reference
 * to the appropriate ViewPropertyAnimator object for that View.</p>
